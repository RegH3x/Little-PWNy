# TLD Parser in Go

The `tld` package has the same API ([see godoc](http://godoc.org/github.com/jpillora/go-tld)) as `net/url` except `tld.URL` contains extra fields: `Subdomain`, `Domain`, `TLD` and `Port`.

### Install

```
go get github.com/jpillora/go-tld
```

### Usage

``` go
package main

import (
	"fmt"

	"github.com/jpillora/go-tld"
)

func main() {
	u, _ := tld.Parse("http://a.very.complex-domain.co.uk:8080/foo/bar")

	fmt.Printf("[ %s ] [ %s ] [ %s ] [ %s ] [ %s ]", u.Subdomain, u.Domain, u.TLD, u.Port, u.Path)
}
```

```
$ go run main.go
[ a.very ] [ complex-domain ] [ co.uk ] [ 8080 ] [ /foo/bar ]
```
